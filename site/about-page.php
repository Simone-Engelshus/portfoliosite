                <p>
                    I am a Graphic Designer, Web Designer and front-end Web Developer who graduated with a Bachelor of Graphic Design from University of Canberra, Australia, in 2016 and a Diploma of Web Development in 2020.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    So far in my career I have worked in marketing, social media and web design & development, and am primarily focused in the digital department. I have also branched out into areas such as illustration and other graphic works.<br />
                    I am passionate about art & design, and I am always looking to learn more and improve on my skills.<br />
                    I aspire to becoming a designer that can create professional, creative and aesthetically pleasing works that serve their purpose well and that I can look back on with pride.
